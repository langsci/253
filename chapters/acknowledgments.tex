The present book is a thoroughly revised version of a substantial part of my PhD dissertation, defended in \citealt{May2017} (Van \citealt{Rooy2017}). As such, it is an outcome of a four-year PhD fellowship, generously granted by the Research Foundation â€“ Flanders (FWO) and conducted at KU Leuven, my main alma mater. The research leading up to this monograph was carried out in the best possible circumstances at the Leuven Center for the Historiography of Linguistics (CHL), where I could enjoy the invaluable guidance of two of the finest mentors, Toon Van Hal and Pierre Swiggers. This book has greatly benefitted from their feedback as well as from that of the two other members of my supervisory committee, John Considine and Lambert Isebaert. Special thanks are due to the latter, as it was under his supervision that I first embarked on studying the fascinating history of Greek dialectology during my studies at UCLouvain in 2012/2013. Many chapters of the book were written and finalized during a long research stay in the ancient capital of eloquence and elegance, Athens, in the Winter semester of 2018/2019, made possible by an FWO travel grant. I am also much indebted to the editorial care of James McElvenny, who greatly improved the English phrasing at numerous instances, and to Nina Markl for her typesetting efforts.
